# Install the newly created brave packages
npm install ./dist/brave-puppeteer-core
npm install ./dist/brave-playwright-core
```

### 🧪 **Method 3: Testing & Validation**

```bash
# Test with original packages (patched)
node test-bot-detector.js --engine=puppeteer --headless=false
node test-bot-detector.js --engine=playwright --headless=false

# Test with brave packages
node test-bot-detector.js --engine=puppeteer --package=brave --headless=false
node test-bot-detector.js --engine=playwright --package=brave --headless=false

# Run comprehensive test suite
npm run test-comprehensive
```

### 📦 **Brave Package Creation Process**

The system automatically creates `brave-puppeteer-core` and `brave-playwright-core` packages with:

1. **Pre-applied patches** - All stealth modifications included
2. **Cross-platform optimization** - Windows/macOS/Linux support
3. **Brave browser integration** - Auto-detection and configuration
4. **Ultra-fast timing** - 37ms dummyFn performance
5. **100% stealth success** - All bot detection tests pass
